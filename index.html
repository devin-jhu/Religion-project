  <p style="border:2px solid black; background-color:white;"> Every time you donate 75% of the money goes to getting people the help they need like, therapy for people who can't afford it. The other 25% goes to the campaign, funding commercials and other kinds of advertisements and features that would benefit the campaign. 
  <h3 style="border:2px solid black; background-color:white;text-align: center"> The Problem </h3>
  <p style="border:2px solid black; background-color:white;"> 1/4 people will suffer from mental health issues in their lifetime. Many of those people dont tell anyone so they don't get the help they need. Others just don't have the money to afford therapy. Since 2010 mental health in teens and young adults has been on the rise. The numbers were fairly balanced and then in 2011, the percentage of teens with mental health problems skyrocketed . These numbers prove that mental health in teens has increased. 4000 people die by suicide every year and 450 million people suffer from it and these numbers may never go down but we can help by continuing to aid people who have them.
  <h3 style="border:2px solid black; background-color:white;text-align: center">Our Solution</h3>
  <p style="border:2px solid black; background-color:white;"> Giving people in need the money for the therapy they need. Giving people a safe space to talk about their mental health online. We will also provide the suicide hotline down below and remember that although it feels like it, you are not alone in your struggles.</p>

  <h3 style="border:2px solid black; background-color:white;text-align: center">Things You Can Do If You know Someone With Mental Health Problems</h3>
  <p style="border:2px solid black; background-color:white;">If you know someone that has a mental health issue just be there for them. For example if they are having a bad day just reassure them that you are there for them. Also make sure that their parents know and that they are getting help. Don’t feel that it  is specifically your job to help your friend with their mental health . </p>
